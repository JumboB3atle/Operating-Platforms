# Operating-Platforms

# 1) The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted us to take their game, Draw It or Lose It, and develop a web-based game that would serve multiple platforms based on the current game version, which was only available as an Android app. 
# 2) One thing that I did particularly well in this document was the evaluation portion. For each operating system (OS) I identified things they did well, things they did not do well, and what considerations should be made when considering that OS. This needs to be identified in the evaluation step because it will be where you will provide evidence to support your recommendation when presenting to the client the strengths and weaknesses of the OS on the server side, and client side, and what tools each will need for development. 
# 3) When designing code the Domain model and the UML diagram were of the most help. This is because they outline what each part of the program was supposed to do and how they will interact with each other part in the program. 
# 4) If I were to change something in the document it would be the Domain model. I could have provided more information on each part of the program which would have possibly made the code writing process run a little smoother.
